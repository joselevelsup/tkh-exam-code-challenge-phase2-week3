# Exam Code and Verbal Portion

## Instructions
You are building a simple web application, and you need to implement user authentication using Express.js. Create the necessary routes and middleware functions for user registration, login, and authentication.

### User Registration
- Create a route for registering a new user with the following information: username and password.
- Store user information securely (you can use an in-memory store for simplicity).

### User Login
- Create a route for user login with the following information: username and password.
- Implement authentication to verify the entered username and password against the stored user information.
- Send back a "token" to the client

### Protected Route
- Create a protected route that requires authentication.
- Only authenticated users should be able to access this route.

#### Notes
- Ensure that your code is organized and follows best practices for Express.js applications.
- Feel free to structure your code as you see fit and include any additional features you think would enhance the authentication system. Good luck!
- You can run the server locally and test if needed
- Run the test suite using `npm run test`. **DO NOT ALTER ANY OF THE TESTS**
- You may also use the test suite as a reference
